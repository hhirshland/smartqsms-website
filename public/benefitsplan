Transplant services
Eligible health services include transplant services provided by a physician and hospital.

This includes the following transplant types:
•  Solid organ
•  Hematopoietic stem cell
•  Bone marrow
•  CAR-T and T Cell receptor therapy for FDA-approved treatments

Network of transplant facilities
We designate facilities to provide specific services or procedures. They are listed as Institutes of Excellence™ (IOE) facilities in your provider directory.

Important note:
•  Many pre and post transplant medical services, even routine ones, are related to and may affect the success of your transplant. While your transplant care is being coordinated by the National Medical Excellence Program® (NME), all medical services must be managed through the NME so that you receive the highest level of benefits at the appropriate facility. This is true even if the eligible health service is not directly related to your transplant.

Exclusions:
Except as described above, or in the Specific therapies and tests and Outpatient prescription drugs sections, the following are not eligible health services under this section:
•  Services and supplies furnished to a donor when the recipient is not a covered person
•  Harvesting and storage of organs, without intending to use them for immediate transplantation for your existing illness
•  Harvesting and/or storage of bone marrow, hematopoietic stem cells, or other blood cells without intending to use them for transplantation within 12 months from harvesting, for an existing illness
•  Any device that would perform the function of a body organ

Important note:
Some of the exclusions listed above may be covered under the following sections:
•  Specific therapies and tests
•  Outpatient prescription drugs

Treatment of infertility Basic infertility
Eligible health services include seeing a network provider:
•  To diagnose and evaluate the underlying medical cause of infertility.
•  To do surgery to treat the underlying medical cause of infertility. Examples are endometriosis surgery
or, for men, varicocele surgery.

Exclusions:
Except as described above, or in the Hospital and other facility care and Outpatient prescription drugs sections, the following are not eligible health services under this section
•  Injectable infertility medication, including but not limited to menotropins, hCG, and GnRH agonists.
•  Infertility is not covered for the purposes of surrogacy. A surrogate is a female carrying her own genetically related child where the child is conceived with the intention of turning the child over to be

Our NIU is here to help you. It is staffed by a dedicated team of registered nurses and infertility coordinators with expertise in all areas of infertility who can help:
•  Enroll in the infertility program.
•  Assist you with precertification of eligible health services.
•  Coordinate precertification for comprehensive infertility when these services are eligible health
AL HCOC 07                    31                           OH 70

services.
•  Evaluate your medical records to determine whether comprehensive infertility services are reasonably likely to result in success.
•  Determine whether comprehensive infertility services are eligible health services.

Your provider will request approval from us in advance for your infertility services. We will cover charges made by an infertility specialist for the following infertility services:
•  Ovulation induction cycle(s) with menotropins.
•  Intrauterine insemination.

A “cycle” is an attempt at ovulation induction or intrauterine insemination. The cycle begins with the initiation of therapy and ends when the treatment is followed by confirmation of non-pregnancy (either a negative pregnancy test or a menstrual period). In the case of the achievement of pregnancy, a cycle is considered completed at 6 weeks following a positive pregnancy test. Each treatment type is counted as a separate cycle.

Advanced reproductive technology
Eligible health services include Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART). ART services are more advanced medical procedures or treatments performed to help a woman achieve pregnancy.

ART services
ART services include:
•  In vitro fertilization (IVF)
•  Zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT)
•  Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT)
•  Cryopreserved embryo transfers (Frozen Embryo Transfers (FET))
•  Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or ovum microsurgery

You are eligible for ART services if:
•  You are covered under this plan as an employee or as a covered dependent who is the employee’s legal spouse or domestic partner, referred to as “your partner”. Dependent children are covered under this plan for ART services only in the case of fertility preservation due to planned treatment for medical conditions that will result in infertility.
•  There exists a condition that:
-  Is demonstrated to cause the disease of infertility.
-  Has been recognized by your physician or infertility specialist and documented in your or your partner’s medical records.
•  You or your partner has not had a voluntary sterilization, with or without surgical reversal, regardless of post reversal results. This includes tubal ligation, hysterectomy and vasectomy only if obtained as a form of voluntary sterilization.
•  You or your partner does not have infertility that is due to a natural physiologic process such as age related ovarian insufficiency (e.g. perimenopause, menopause).
•  A successful pregnancy cannot be attained through less costly treatment for which coverage is available under this plan.
•  You have exhausted the comprehensive infertility services benefits or have a clinical need to move on to ART procedures. You have met the requirement for the number of months trying to conceive through egg and sperm contact.

•  If you have been diagnosed with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), as described in our clinical policy bulletin, you are eligible for ART services through age 45 regardless of FSH level.

Fertility preservation
Fertility preservation involves the retrieval of mature eggs and/or sperm or the creation of embryos that are frozen for future use. You are eligible for fertility preservation only when you:
•  Are believed to be fertile
•  Have planned services that will result in infertility such as:
-  Chemotherapy
-  Pelvic radiotherapy
-  Other gonadotoxic therapies
-  Ovarian or testicular removal

Along with the eligibility requirements above, you are eligible for fertility preservation benefits if, for example:
•  You, your partner or dependent child are planning treatment that is demonstrated to result in infertility. Planned treatments include:
-  Bilateral orchiectomy (removal of both testicles)
-  Bilateral oophorectomy (removal of both ovaries)
-  Hysterectomy (removal of the uterus)
-  Chemotherapy or radiation therapy that is established in medical literature to result in infertility
•  The eggs that will be retrieved for use are reasonably likely to result in a successful pregnancy by meeting the criteria below:


You are


AL HCOC 07
You need to have an unmedicated day 3 FSH test done within the past:

Must be less than 19 mIU/mL in your most recent lab test to use your own eggs.
If you are less than age 40, must be less than 19 mIU/mL in your most recent lab test.
If you are age 40 and older, must be less than 19 mIU/mL in all prior tests performed after age 40.

Eligible health services for fertility preservation will be paid on the same basis as other ART services benefits for individuals who are infertile.

Our National Infertility Unit (NIU) is here to help you. It is staffed by a dedicated team of registered nurses and
infertility coordinators with expertise in all areas of infertility who can help:
•  Enroll in the infertility program.
•  Assist you with precertification of eligible health services.
•  Coordinate precertification for ART services and fertility preservation services when these services are eligible health services. Your provider should obtain precertification for fertility preservation services through the NIU either directly or through a reproductive endocrinologist.
•  Evaluate your medical records to determine whether ART services and fertility preservation services are reasonably likely to result in success.
•  Determine whether ART services and fertility preservation services are eligible health services.
•  Case manage for the provision of ART services and fertility preservation services for an eligible covered person.

Your provider will request approval from us in advance for your ART services and fertility preservation services. We will cover charges made by an ART specialist for the following ART services:
•  Any combination of the following ART services:
-  In vitro fertilization (IVF)*
-  Zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT)
-  Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT)
-  Cryopreserved embryo transfers (Frozen Embryo Transfer (FET))
•  Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or ovum microsurgery.
•  Charges associated with your care when using a gestational carrier including egg retrieval and culture and fertilization of your eggs that will be transferred into a gestational carrier. The embryo transfer itself is not covered. (See the What your plan doesn't cover - some eligible health service exceptions section.)
•  Charges associated with your care when you will receive a donor egg or embryo in a donor IVF cycle. These services include culture and fertilization of the egg from the donor and transfer of the embryo into you.
•  Charges associated with obtaining sperm from your partner when they are covered under this plan for ART services.
•  The procedures are done while not confined in a hospital or any other facility as an inpatient.

A “cycle” is an attempt at a particular type of infertility treatment (e.g., GIFT, ZIFT, cryopreserved embryo transfers). The cycle begins with the initiation of therapy and ends when the treatment is followed
by confirmation of non-pregnancy (either a negative pregnancy test or a menstrual period). In the case of the achievement of pregnancy, a cycle is considered completed at 6 weeks following a positive pregnancy test. Each treatment type is counted as a separate cycle.

*Note: In some plans with limits on the number of cycles of IVF covered, “one” cycle of IVF may be considered as one elective single embryo transfer (ESET) cycle followed consecutively by a frozen single embryo transfer cycle. This cycle definition applies only to individuals who meet the criteria for ESET, as determined by our NIU and for whom the initial ESET cycle did not result in a documented fetal heartbeat. Eligible health services for ESET will be paid on the same basis as any other ART services benefit.


Specific therapies and tests

Outpatient diagnostic testing Diagnostic complex imaging services
Eligible health services include complex imaging services by a provider, including:
•  Computed tomography (CT) scans
•  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) and Magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA)
•  Nuclear medicine imaging including Positron emission tomography (PET) scans Complex imaging for preoperative testing is covered under this benefit.
Diagnostic lab work and radiological services
Eligible health services include diagnostic radiological services (other than diagnostic complex imaging), lab services, and pathology and other tests, but only when you get them from a licensed radiological facility or lab.

Chemotherapy
Eligible health services for chemotherapy depends on where treatment is received. In most cases, chemotherapy is covered as outpatient care. However, your hospital benefit covers the initial dose of chemotherapy after a cancer diagnosis during a hospital stay.

Coverage for oral anti-cancer prescription drugs will not be less favorable than for intravenously or injected anti-cancer prescription drugs.

Outpatient infusion therapy
Eligible health services include infusion therapy you receive in an outpatient setting including but not limited to:
•  A free-standing outpatient facility
•  The outpatient department of a hospital
•  A physician in the office
•  A home care provider in your home

Infusion therapy is the parenteral (i.e. intravenous) administration of prescribed medications or solutions.

Limitations
Certain infused medications may be covered under the outpatient prescription drug coverage. You can access the list of specialty prescription drugs by contacting Member Services or by logging onto your Aetna member website at www.aetna.com or calling the number on your ID card to determine if coverage is under the outpatient prescription drug benefit or this certificate.
